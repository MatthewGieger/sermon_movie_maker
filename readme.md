## What is it?
A python script that converts an mp3 file + an image file into a mp4 video with a static image along with sermon details as an overlay to the image. These videos can then be uploaded to the church website and/or the church facebook page.


## How to Use it

1. Double click the SermonMovieMaker app in the 'dist' directory.

2. When prompted, enter the following information:

	a. Full path to image file (you can drag the file into the terminal)

	b. Full path to mp3 file (you can drag the file into the terminal)

	c. Name of the mp4 file to be generated (excluding the extension)

	d. First line of text (Sermon Title)

	e. Second line of text (Speaker Name)

	f. Third line of text (Date)


3. The program will then get to work on exporting the mp4 file to the location set in the settings file.

Note: Other settings can be changed in the settings.py file to modify the appearance of the overlaid text, location of the font file, output directory, etc.
